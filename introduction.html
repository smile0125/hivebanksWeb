      <h2 class="section-header section-header--intro" id="why-we-need">Why do we need digital assets bank</h2>
      <p class="intro-content">
        With the advancement of the Internet and digitization process, people will have more and more valuable digital assets, among which the digital currency is the main form.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Due to the high technical threshold of digital currency management, ordinary people are not professional enough and are also inconvenient to keep digital currency by themselves.  As a result, digital assets will easily be lost or be stolen by hacker.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Bitcoin, the mainstream digital currency, is limited by blockchain size that induces to long transaction transfer confirmation time and high transaction fee.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Digital asset bank’s book transfer service which excludes the digital currency blockchain limitation and can accelerate the circulation of digital currency blockchainand. It also is more convenient for users to confirm both parties’ entity qualification through information such as identity authentication.

        Due to wide varieties of digital currencies, user can freely exchange any digital currency through the digital bank's digital currency agent as well.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        If local law and bank’s support are available, user can freely convert local legal currency to any digital currency via digital bank’s legal currency agent.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        When global digital banks that use the same open source code are connected to each other, user can therefore easily  execute the conversion of digital currency and legal currency. 
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">

      <!-- 数字资产银行和数字货币交易所有什么不同 -->
      <h2 class="section-header section-header--intro" id="different-from-bourse">Difference between digital assets bank and <br> currency exchange</h2>
      <p class="intro-content">
        The main difference from digital currency exchange is that digital asset bank does not have the concept of placing order. User cannot set a prefer price to sell or buy a certain digital currency.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Like ordinary bank that provides currency exchange service, users can convert CNY to Dollars and verse visa.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Because it is impossible to place a fixed-price buy/sell order, people will not call foreign currency exchange bank as foreign currency exchange.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        In addition, although people can convert legal currency into digital currency or convert digital currency into legal currency. unlike digital currency exchange, digital bank charge a high handling fee for customer's redemption operations to curb user's impulse for frequent tradings.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Since digital currencies are mostly issued by deflation, different from ordinary bank, digital asset bank generally adopt zero or even negative interest rate.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Therefore, digital asset bank may also charge user a digital assets custodian fee, whereas general digital currency exchange will not charge for this service.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        On the other hand, digital bank does not provide futures or leveraging instrument like digital currency exchanges and it becomes more suitable for conservative investor.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-header section-header--intro" id="different-from-wallet">Difference between digital assets bank and <br> digital currency wallet</h2>
      <p class="intro-content">
        In general, digital currency wallet is an application for a particular currency uses by an individual.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        It is only suitable for same digital currency transfer and does not have the ability to exchange between various digital currencies nor conversion to legal currency.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        And if there is a problem happened on the digital currency wallet application such as operation system failure, or  individual user will face the risk of digital currency being lost or stolen if he/she uses it improperly.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        In general, wallet application developer does not bear these risks; however, a powerful digital asset bank is capable to take risk in these areas.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-header section-header--intro" id="competitors-and-advantages">Main competitors and advantages of <br> digital currency bank</h2>
      <p class="intro-content">
        The major opponent of digital asset bank benchmarks is the existing banking system of various legal currencies.On the other hand, main users are long-term investors and ordinary users who own digital currency assets.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Rigid Cashing Protection Benefits: Digital Asset Bank can publicly display their cashing ability to all users through blockchain technology. However, the existing banking system is unable to do so and can only rely on the credit guarantee or policy guarantee provided by the local government.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Global integration advantages: Digital asset banks can take advantage of the digital currency's public notarization function on the blockchain, making digital assets more convenient for inter-digital bank interactions. After connecting with each other, digital bank can provide users around the world an integrated financial platform; and, thereby to create a higher quality and a more reliable financial service.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        The disadvantages of traditional banks: The existing legal currency banking system is greatly affected by country policies currency monetary policies. Besides, traditional banking’s system technology is old and outdated, system enhancement difficult, organizations are inflated, and decision-making is slow.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        It also does not support digital currency and digital assets business. Tradital bank has many hard assets, high resistance to change, weak market competitiveness, failure of interaction among banks between countries, and weak overseas competitiveness.

      <!-- 为什么我们选择开源 -->
      <h2 class="section-header section-header--intro" id="why-open-source">Why do we choose open source</h2>
      <p class="intro-content">
        We choose open source code because open source code is the most easiest way to gain everyone’s trust - the longer the open source time, the higher the security level of the code.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        It is unanimous how open source code and bank to gain user’s trust: firstly, it is security, and second, it is historical reputation.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        At present, the most secure and stable, and the most widely used computer operating system in the server area “Linux” is open source basis.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Furthermore, what we are building is a distributed banking system. The open source code is convenient for anyone to create a local digital bank effectively and efficiently in any country, any region to provide digital assets services to local citizen that has digital banking needs.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Open source also means that even if we quit, there will still be interested programmers or related stakeholders to ensure that the entire open source system continues to optimize and continue to advance.
